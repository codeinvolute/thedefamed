#Why?
Because, I had to manage many servers and had a file of ssh commands. And I had to copy and past the command lines each and everytime I want to loginto a server/instance.

#For whom?
Definitely geeks, who manage many servers.

#How to use?
As I have told simplyfies the copy paste work;

1. add your ssh commands to file(or any other name)
2. specify the path for the same in your connect.sh(or anyname you had) 
3. if shows any error while running file run (as ./connect.sh) the following command
  1. chmod u+x connect.sh
4. loads the file with ssh commands 
5. all you have to do is to select the line you want to execute/use as your command line.
