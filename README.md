#Why?
Because, I had to manage many servers and had a file of ssh commands. And I had to copy and past the command lines each and everytime I want to loginto a server/instance.

#For whom?
Definitely geeks, who manage many servers of clients

#What is the use of this tool?
As I have told simplyfies the copy paste work;
loads the file with ssh commands 
all you have to do is to select the line you want to execute/use as your command line.

#what awaits the future upgrade?
I want to add a serch tool.. :-w (if possible). 

#who am I and How I developed this?
I had 0 knowledge in bash scripting till past 90 mins. Yes, developed all this in 90mins. Not sure if I took less time or more. But if you have any ideas to improvise my code am very much interested in your help :)
